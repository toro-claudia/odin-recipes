    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> This twist on traditional scrambled eggs not only provides a depth to your average
        omelet, but was a staple for me growing up and led me to providing my own twist for 
        me to pass down. Truthfully, I never liked the taste of plain eggs and always wanted
        it to taste more, not just decorated with other ingredients such as cheese or ketchup
        (gross, sorry.) This tomato egg recipe does have a more savory approach than most
        recipes, I will warn you, however if this sounds like something you'd like I urge
        you to try it!
    </p>
    <p> This recipe is for 2 people, however adjust each ingredient depending on your
        preference of tomatoes and level of savoryness.
